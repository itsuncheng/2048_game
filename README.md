# 2048_game
This is a rebuild of the classic 2048 game that is usually played on portable devices. You can play the online version [here](https://play2048.co/). Instead of programming in a high level language, MIPS which is a low level language is used. 

This project is completed for COMP2611: Computer Organization.
